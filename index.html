This is the Poetic Mind of Jontae Hall
<br>
I am not 100% sure of what is to go here, so I will just try to demonstrate things that I've learned in this lesson.  I am excited to maybe one day be able to work on my on  <a href="www.yourbrotherskeepers.org">website</a> <br>
This is aweson.  Here is a picture of me and my friends at a health workshop.  That's me sitting in the center.'<img src="http://nebula.wsimg.com/07599d0834746381bcc12d9c3ab8fa5a?AccessKeyId=C6C65A6BBE531ED30CF4&disposition=0&alloworigin=1" alt= "Jontae Hall">
